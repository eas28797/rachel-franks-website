		<h1>About Me</h1>	
<!--this will be the first thing seen when you scroll the first time. Since I included this on the mockup, I went ahead and included a little segment from her.-->
		<p>
		I hold my Bachelor's degree in sociology from the Cormier Honors College of Longwood University.
		I have completed my master's degree from Grand Canyon University in special education. 
		I have accepted my invitation into the Alpha Chi Honor Society, an honor I hold dearly for having an academic standing in the top 10% of my class nationwide.
		My absolute favorite part of teaching is watching students make new connections and accomplish their goals.
		My strong suit is in building relationships and making connections with students, and I use this in my application of behavioral support.
